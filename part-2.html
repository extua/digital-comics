                <h1 class="section-heading">How Digital Comics are different from print comics</h1>
                <p>Most of the approaches taken toward digital comics so far don&#39;t really take the digital medium fully into account. In trying to adapt the known experience of printed comics onto a screen, they design comics layouts as if they were still designing for a static, one-size page. The metaphor of the page is a tough one to break—we&#39;ve been living with it for 500 years. But a screen—or rather, a continuum of screens—has very different characteristics from a printed page in a book. </p>

                <p>The printed page is immutable, and fixed in size. It is also static. An individual screen on a particular user&#39;s device is also immutable, and fixed in size, but it&#39;s not static, and this is the place where most comics are playing these days: taking advantage of the internal fluidity of the screen to do things like displaying an infinite canvas, light interaction and animations, superimposing panel states to depict action over time, etc. but always within the context of a particular viewport size. This is a limiting approach: storytellers end up designing page layouts for, say, an iPad, or a Kindle Fire, or another, arbitrary screen size defined by a single target platform. But this approach isn&#39;t scalable: it&#39;s by definition bespoke to a particular screen—or more accurately, viewport size, to use web design parlance.</p>

                <p>But on the web, creators can&#39;t count on a piece of content being seen on just the one type of screen or device that they&#39;re designing for—for instance, we can&#39;t expect all comics readers out there to go buy an iPad. </p>

                <p>The reality of screens is that they&#39;re not one, immutable thing—screens have unique characteristics that are different from printed, paper pages. When designing for screens, we&#39;ve discovered that<a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/">screens are fluid surfaces</a>, and the way we design content for them must change to suit. </p>

                <p>More crucially, as the general web design community has discovered, targeting one screen size or another is a losing game of whack-a-mole. Instead of focusing on one layout, or one device, it&#39;s best to design <em>systems</em> that can be displayed across a multitude of viewing conditions, rather than concentrating on one screen size, or one device.</p>

                <p>The approaches to digital comics so far also take for granted that the way creators <em>make</em> comics is pretty inviolate—that the way we write scripts, sketch breakdowns, and produce art is the best way possible for producing art for comics. The final output for this process is usually either one large raster image per page, or at best, a collection of sliced-up raster images.</p>

                <h2 class="section-sub-heading">Unique attributes of a digital comic</h2>
                <p>A networked, screen-based comic has some very different characteristics from the printed page.</p>  

                <h3 class="section-sub-heading" id="viewport-variance">Viewport variance</h3>
                <p>In print, one of the major constraints is the size of the paper on which we’re printing. A 6&quot; x 9&quot; printed comic is always six inches by nine inches, no matter what. These static dimensions define the bounds of our viewing surface as a unit of storytelling, too; the visual storyteller must conform their layout to the confines of that printed page.</p>

                <p>Devices for viewing the web, on the other hand, run the gamut of possible sizes: from tiny handheld devices to full-sized tablets, and, increasingly, large-format displays that I like to call &#39;<a href="https://medium.com/@pablod/reading-on-the-big-screen-8b9f4a028267">digital broadsides</a>.&#39; On the open web, it&#39;s almost impossible for the designer to predict what the <em>viewport size</em> will be when a reader loads up their work on their device. This calls for fluid, responsive layouts, that adapt to varied and often unpredictable screen sizes. </p>
                

                <h3 class="section-sub-heading" id="viewing-conditions">Viewing conditions</h3>
                <p>In the same way that the web has a myriad display surfaces, it also has an unknowable number of viewing conditions. Bandwidth, language, and screen resolution are only a few of the variables that designers on the web need to take into account. </p>

                <p>A reader could be viewing a site on a high-solution iPad, pulling it in through a high-bandwidth connection in Hong Kong; on the &#39;experimental&#39; web browser on their black-and-white Kindle, in rural Mexico; or on a small, low-resolution Android phone in New York.</p>

                <p>Responsible designers need to take this variance into account, and Cate content that can adapt to these unpredictable variables as gracefully as possible.</p>                

                <h2 class="section-sub-heading">Some drawbacks of current approaches</h2>
                <p>Most of the current approaches to digital comics out there share a few key shortcomings:</p>

                <h3 class="section-sub-heading" id="the-static-page-metaphor">The static page metaphor</h3>
                <p>Both methods of making digital comics outlined earlier still cling to the metaphor of the static, fixed-dimension page as a framework for designing, displaying, and consuming comics on a screen. This means always working within a static, fixed dimension viewport, either inside a web browser, or in an app.</p>

                <p>The comics created for these applications are mostly designed with a specific page dimension in mind—usually 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which is the size of an American print comic. While this can certainly be convenient, especially when repurposing the digital comic for a print run, it can be an awkward fit when reading on digital devices. </p>

                <p>For example, when viewing full-page comics created for a 6&quot; x 9&quot; page on an iPad Air, the sides of the device&#39;s screen are effectively wasted, creating an odd &#39;lateral letterboxing&#39; effect which highlights the fact that the comic has been awkwardly adapted to fit the viewport.</p>                

			    <h3 class="section-sub-heading" id="undermining-page-level-storytelling">Undermining page-level storytelling</h3>
                <p>Panel-by-panel presentations of digital comics, like Comixology&#39;s Guided View, fundamentally undermine one of the most interesting (yet often overlooked) aspects of sequential art, and arguably one of the attributes that makes a comic, a comic: the use of a full-page layout design to create a visual rhythm that reinforces the narrative being depicted from panel to panel.</p>

                <p>The fundamental unit of storytelling in comics is the full page layout, not the individual panel. The magic of comics happens when you have that visual juxtaposition of two panels. Otherwise you just have a series of related images, being presented to the reader in order. The best comics storytellers understand this, and work in what <a href="https://www.paulduffield.co.uk/articles/comics-and-the-value-of-language-part-2">Paul Duffield calls “comics mode”</a>:</p>                

                <blockquote>Comics live in the expressive, representative and symbolic nature of a drawing, in the comic page when treated as an interconnected piece of art, in the reader’s ability to “pause”, “rewind”, “rewatch” and linger on a moment at their hearts content. Comics thrive when each panel doesn’t just represent a mechanical shot-by-shot advancing of the plot, but a carefully considered and timed “beat” which enforces an emotion, underlines a joke or teases out a dramatic moment. Comics excel when the artist understands how to guide the reader’s eye around the page, when a layout does more than frame a sequence of images, when the story is expressed non-photographically and when the qualities of the artwork beam the characters’ emotional states right into the reader’s head before they read a word of dialogue.</blockquote>
                

			    <h3 class="section-sub-heading" id="un-semantic-blobs">Un-semantic blobs</h3>
                <p>For example, using Guided View for reading a page from Matt Fraction and David Aja’s excellent Hawkeye gets the job done. But readers are missing out—there&#39;s a rhythm to a page on Hawkeye, and Aja and Fraction have worked to guide the reader through the sequence of panels in a particular order. The size and placement of the panels in relation to each other works to convey an emotional state to the reader.</p>

                <p>These days, devices like the Retina iPad Air make panel-by-panel presentations unnecessary, since the screen is sharp enough to render text and art legibly, and the sizes are large enough to more or less accommodate full-page layouts.</p>

                <h3 class="section-sub-heading" id="un-semantic-blobs">Relying on print-centric conventions</h3>
                <p>The digital context, being unique, has unique storytelling strengths and weaknesses, and some strengths from print don’t translate well into digital. We need to figure out what to keep form print, but we need to also realize what to leave behind.</p>

                <p>To give just one example: printed comics often use the double-page spread to wonderful effect. It allows the artist a larger canvas on which to experiment with dynamic, unorthodox layouts, or it gives them a chance to insert an epic panorama into the clipped rhythm of a panel-by-panel narrative, in order to showcase a big reveal, or provide an emotional release in the narrative arc of a story.</p>

                <p>But on the iPad, for example, double-page spreads become a nuisance, rather than an enhancement: reader has to flip their tablet over into landscape mode to see it at a legible size, and even then, it’s still at a smaller size than the previous page, since the proportions of the artwork designed for the printed page are different from the proportions of my iPad’s screen. </p>

                <p>This creates the exact opposite of what was intended: the double page spread feels smaller and more cramped, rather than bigger and more expansive. Something that works to surprise and delight the reader in print becomes a bit of friction to the digital reader on a tablet.</p>
