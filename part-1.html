                <h1 class="section-heading">Current Approaches to Digital Comics</h1>
                <p>There have been many explorations of digital comics over the years. Every new approach or perspective brings new insights to the table. In Reinventing Comics, Scott McCloud laid out an initial stab at the concept of an 'infinite canvas,' which sought to break from the confines of the static, rigid page, and take advantage of the new spatial fluidity inherent in digital media. While others have built upon this early experimental work, over the the last few years the field has settled into what seem to be two main approaches to creating comics for display on digital media.</p>
                <h2 class="section-sub-heading" id="panel-by-panel-presentation">Panel-by-Panel Presentation</h2>
                <p>In 2009, ComiXology launched their ‘Comics by ComiXology’ reading service, which brought single-issue print comic books — or ‘floppies’ — to the web. ComiXology really took off the following year, with the release of the iPad and the introduction of their iPad app.</p>
                <p>Since a page of a printed comic is larger than even a full-size iPad Air, regular print comics seldom looked good on early tablets, which were smaller and low-resolution. Never mind trying to read a full page of a comic on an iPhone—a full page of a printed comic was completely illegible on small, handheld devices.</p>
                <p>To solve this problem, ComiXology devised a brilliant hack: their Guided View presentation allows for full-screen, panel-by-panel viewing of a page from a comic. The reader swipes or taps the screen of their device to advance to the next panel on the page.</p>
                <p>Using Guided View, it doesn't matter how small a device is, any comic properly processed by ComiXology will be legible on any size device. ComiXology did wonders to get mainstream, American comics readers onto digital, and their success led to becoming the principal digital comics platform in the US, and in 2011, they were acquired by Amazon. They are still the predominant player in digital comics in the United States—most major publishers adapt their print comics for distribution on ComiXology's platform.</p>
                <h2 class="section-sub-heading" id="the-balak-framework">The Balak Framework</h2>
                <p>Sometime around the same time that ComiXology got started, a DeviantArt user named Balak posted an experiment in digital comics.</p>
                <p>Using Flash, Balak transformed the ‘page’ into a landscape-oriented frame where panels come in one by one as the reader clicks. He layered individual panels one on top of the other to create a sense of time.</p>
                <p>This unmooring of the page from the static world of print, and transforming it into a frame for fluid storytelling was inspiring: the mutable nature of each ‘page’ allowed Balak to build on top of previous panels. He used variations on the same basic panel art to communicate a sense of action over time.</p>
                <p>Comics using Balak's conceptual framework rely on an arbitrary static frame which is laid out inside of whatever screen is displaying the comic. These comics rely on the assumption that the ‘page’ is a static frame that never changes size, orientation, or proportions—regardless of the actual size or dimensions of the screen that is being used to display the comic. In short, there's no accounting for the fluidity and mutability of the screen that contains that frame.</p>
                <p>Exploring the possibilities of working with the black framework has proven to be fertile ground. Many digital comics makers, such as Mark Waid, Ron Perazza, and many others have done lots of work in this format, primarily through sites like Thrillbent, the Infinite Comics initiative from Marvel Comics, and ComiXology's own Submit program for independent creators.</p>
