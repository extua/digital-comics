                <h1 class="section-heading">Toward a digital comics praxis.</h1>
                <p>Digital comics generally hew to the metaphor of the static page as a framework for designing, laying out, displaying, and reading comics on a screen. Instead, comics storytellers should embrace the fluidity inherent in digital media when designing comics for the screen.</p>
                <p>As more and more readers—both long time and newcomers—are moving to reading their comics exclusively on digital devices.</p>
                <p>Applying digital design techniques from the world of web design and development to how we display comics on screens can dramatically improve the reading experience, and also decrease complexity when trying to deliver a comic across a wide gamut of devices, platforms, and network conditions.</p>
                <p>Additionally, these techniques can also affect the way creators design comics for this new medium. Keeping these technical capabilities in mind can open up storytelling possibilities that wouldn't be possible in print, or by otherwise sticking to a static page paradigm for digital comics.</p>
                <p>This site depicts one possible approach to building comics directly out of HTML, CSS, SVG, and vector images, using responsive design techniques. It's meant to be a starting point for further explorations of the ways in which we can create and display comics on screens.</p>
