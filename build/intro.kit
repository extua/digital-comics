                <p>As more and more readers—both long time and newcomers—are moving to reading their comics exclusively on digital devices, applying digital design techniques to how we display comics on screens can dramatically improve the reading experience, and also decrease cost and complexity when trying to deliver a comic across a wide gamut of devices, platforms, and network conditions.</p>
                <p>Fundamentally, these techniques can also affect the way creators design comics for this new medium. Keeping these technical capabilities in mind can open up storytelling possibilities that wouldn't be possible in print, or by sticking to a static page paradigm for digital comics.</p>
                <p>This site depicts one possible approach to building comics directly out of HTML, CSS, SVG, and vector images, using responsive design techniques. I'll also show a few examples of interesting layout, pacing, and storytelling techniques that start to scratch the surface of some of the novel things comics creators working in the digital space can achieve.</p>
